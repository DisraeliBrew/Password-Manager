Contributions Week 1:
---------------------
I've outlined the basic website structure and created 3 html pages : the index, registration page for users to enter their details, and a login page for a user to login. I've yet to implement the action links in the form that lead to the information being sent to the backend.

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
Worked with Taylor and Rohan to get the Java FX structure up and running. 
Created the page that the user is taken to once they log in.
Added CSS styling to the index page.

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
Finished up CSS styling for all pages
Finished up the scripting file with Taylor
Added functionality to all pages
Files written by me:
--------------------
index.html
registration.html
userPage.html
login.html

Files submitted with this project that were developed in an earlier project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HashTableMap.java
MapADT.java
ArrayObject.java


Web address at which the program is available:
----------------------------------------------
<If you and your team have written a web app that is available on the internet,
replace this text with its address. This is not a requirement of Project Four
and you will not loose points for not implementing a web application or for not
having a running version on the web.>

Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
code is already in compiled .jar file
makefile is configured for windows
must be run as:
make -f Makefile.win
Please note that for the makefile to work, the Java FX 15 jdk needs to be in the project folder as is given in the makefile. I couldn't upload it because of its size.
Also, for some reason the makefile isn't detecting the FX jar files unless the absolute path is specified in the makefile, so please ensure that the path to the lib folder
of the JDK is an absolute one.
